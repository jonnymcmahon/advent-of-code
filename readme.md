# Advent of Code 2023

Here are my somewhat ropey attempts at Advent of Code 2023 (https://adventofcode.com/)

- Day 1:
    - Difficulty: 3/5
    - Time taken: ~1hr
    - Notes: eightwo really making life miserable here
- Day 2:
    - Difficulty: 1/5
    - Time taken: ~30m
    - Notes: pretty straightforward
- Day 3:
    - Difficulty: 5/5
    - Time taken: ~2.5hrs
    - Notes: absolutely *cursed* code for this one, don't want to talk about it. Probably should've used range() and regex to identify and search through neighbours but ah well
- Day 4:
    - Difficulty: 3/5
    - Time taken: ~1hr
    - Notes: first part pretty straightforward, second part threw my brain a bit of a curveball
- Day 5:
    - Difficulty: 6/5
    - Time taken: ~4hrs
    - Notes: first part relatively easy once the reading was done with, second part took a lot of work... tried not to brute force it and be smart with using ranges - it would've been less computation for my brain to just brute force it :(
- Day 6:
    - Difficulty: 1/5
    - Time taken: ~15m
    - Notes: very straightforward, could've figured out an equation for the second half but was easier to brute force it lol
